## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues:
- ⚠️ ESLint warning: Inline style in ConfirmationDisplay.tsx (line 174) - non-blocking

### Limitations:
- QR scanner requires HTTPS (local dev uses HTTP)
- Camera access requires user permission
- Badge PDF generation is client-side (may be slow for large batches)
- Activity logs stored indefinitely (no cleanup mechanism)
- No email notifications (Resend API key required)
- No admin password protection (code ready, needs activation)

### Future Enhancements:
- Multi-language support
- Export activity logs to CSV
- Email reminders before event
- SMS notifications
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Custom table sizes
- Reserved seating
- Waitlist management
