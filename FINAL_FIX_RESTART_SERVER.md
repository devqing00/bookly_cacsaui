# 🎯 SOLUTION FOUND!

## The Problem

Your `.env.local` file had a **different password hash** that doesn't match `admin123`.

**Old hash in `.env.local`:**
```
$2b$10$mr5nH9sbcqSXVWeneoVs9u3DNnTgPNQv.T19fgPVR.2QsgTSbhO7i
```

**Correct hash for `admin123`:**
```
$2b$10$6f4dB.Mc/gUM4mC.BdzCiekT1dWJV0/qVUDPvSu2qkjdUs63drgvC
```

## ✅ Fix Applied

Updated `.env.local` with the correct hash.

## 🚀 Next Steps (IMPORTANT!)

### 1. STOP the dev server
Press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal

### 2. START the dev server again
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Why restart?** Environment variables are only loaded when the server starts. The old hash is still in memory!

### 3. Try logging in
- Go to `/admin`
- Enter: `admin123`
- Click Login
- **Should work now!** ✅

## 📊 What You'll See in Terminal

**After restart and login, you should see:**
```
=== LOGIN ATTEMPT ===
Password received: ***
Password length: 8
Using hash: $2b$10$6f4dB.Mc/gUM...
Hash source: ENV
Comparing password with hash...
Password valid: true    ← Should be TRUE now!
SUCCESS: Password matched!
Cookie set successfully
=== LOGIN SUCCESS ===
POST /api/admin/auth 200 in XXms    ← Should be 200, not 401!
```

## 🎉 That's It!

The fix is complete. Just restart the server and it will work!
